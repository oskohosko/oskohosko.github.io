            <p class="lead">Here are a list of my complete and future projects. These projects tend to combine my programming and technology skills with my hobbies outside of my studies.</p>
            <p class="lead">I'm currently swamped with Uni Assignments, so once they're done I'll be getting straight back into working on these.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>complete</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">Below here are my complete projects. I may still be working on them, but they are in a presentable state.</p>
            <br>
            <a href="https://github.com/oskohosko/phillip_island/" target="_blank" class="project"><h3><b>House Preferences Web App</b></h3></a>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">This is a web application using Python, Flask, SQLite/Postgres and HTML. Each year my mates and I go for a trip and we sort ourselves into 3 houses of roughly 8 people. This is a web app dedicated to this trip, which allows us to sign up, log in and cast two votes for who we want to be in a house with for the trip.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have deployed this app using Heroku and on the published version I used a Postgres Database rather than SQLite.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/oskohosko/spotify/" target="_blank" class="project"><h3><b>Spotify Playlist Cover Image Maker with Analysis</b></h3></a>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">Using Python, Spotify, Musixmatch and OpenAI's APIs, I've made a program that takes a spotify playlist, grabs track data, lyrics from Musixmatch and uses GPT 3.5 and DALL-E 2 to analyse the lyrics and generate cover images for the playlist based on the analysis.
            <br>
            <br>
            4 images that were generated for my modern/dark techno playlist using DALLE-2:</p>

            <p class="lead">Here are the projects I'm currently working on.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>Need for Speed Heat: Optimal Path/Race Finding</b></h3>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">One of the video games I've been playing a bit recently is Need for Speed: Heat. And one way of making money in the game is by racing. I'm currently doing an AI unit this semester and am learning about search algorithms and I thought it would be cool to apply this to Need for Speed. So, in this project I am trying to use search algorithms to find the best sequence of races I can take in a given amount of time that will give me the most money.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>Spotify Recommended Track Navigator</b></h3>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">Following on from my other Spotify focused project, in this one I am going to choose a starting song and an ending song, and based purely on recommended songs, finding a sequence of songs that leads from the start song to the end song. For example, I could choose a happy song to start with and a sad song to end with and by gathering recommended songs for each song, finding a path of songs that leads from the happy one to the sad one to create a playlist.</p>
