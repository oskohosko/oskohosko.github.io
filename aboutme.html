    <h1><b>about me</b></h1>
    <br>
    <p class="lead">
      I'm a recent graduate from Monash University in Melbourne with a degree in Computer Science.
      I have a particular interest in Software Development, especially in iOS App Development and Full-Stack Development.
      I'm a curious person that loves a challenge, to solve problems and want to make things that can improve and bring enjoyment to peoples' lives.
      <br><br>
      My main technical strengths and interests lie within the world of Swift, JavaScript and Python. I have recently found a love and passion for full-stack and mobile development and am always working on projects and looking to learn new things.
      <br><br>
      Outside of my studies, I'm a very keen golfer, playing every week at Rosebud Country Club.
      Hence, a lot of my projects revolve around golf. I believe it is the most challenging and rewarding sport out there and my projects aim to help myself and hopefully others improve and enjoy the sport just a little bit more.
      <br><br>Alongside golf, I'm a big concert-goer, with an ear for techno, dance and indie music. I also like to dabble in a bit of Chess, studying the game and always trying to improve.
      And finally, I love going to sports events, especially when the Hawks are playing at the 'G.
      <br><br>
      I'm doing my best to keep this page updated as I work on new things. Please checkout out my projects on the next page.
