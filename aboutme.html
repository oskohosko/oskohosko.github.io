            <br>
            <p class="lead">I'm a third-year University student currently studying Computer Science at Monash University Melbourne. I have a particular interest in Software Development and Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>Most of my work so far has been in Python, but as of recent I am trying to delve into some more front-end stuff as well as a little bit of back-end database work.
            <br><br>I've got an active subscription at Codecademy in which I'm currently doing a Machine Learning course as my main focus, with a few other smaller courses on the side to keep my skills up and repertoire wider.
            <br><br>Outside of my studies, I'm a very keen golfer, playing most weeks and exploring Melbourne's extensive amount of amazing golf courses. I'm also a big concert-goer and don't mind a bit of techno, dance and indie music.<br><br>Alongside golf and music, I like to dabble in a bit of Chess, studying the game and always trying to improve. At home, I like to unwind with some video games, mixology and a bit of cooking here and there.<br><br>I love a good challenge and I've designed this little webpage to keep me challenged and display my projects. </p>
